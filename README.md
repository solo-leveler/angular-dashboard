2. For graphs, ApexCharts have been used as per the guidelines. It has not been tampered with much and used only to portray with dummy data.
3. All color codes have been mentioned in root stylesheet. These color codes have been obtained using color pickers available online. 
4. Object/Modals have been used as per the guidelines. Although every component have there own modal but there might be cases where common modal have been used.
